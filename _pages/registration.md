### Welcome to Cambridge’s Sixth season of water polo! 
Here are the details you need to know for the upcoming season.

<br>

Cambridge Water Polo (CWP) is open to all area High School and Middle School aged players.  We are planning to have two teams this year.  There will be one Division 2 (D2) team and one Division 3 (D3) team.  Both teams will be co-ed as we have done since the inception of CWP.  The CWP coaches will determine the rosters for the D2 and D3 teams after tryouts and CWP practices.

<br>

### Summer Clinic and Practices
Plans are being made to have at least one water polo clinic and possibly several scrimmages in June and July.  Coach Lee is still working on these so look forward to more information once plans are confirmed.  These summer CWP events will be available to all players who have completed their American Water Polo Membership, CWP Registration forms, and paid the 2018 CWP registration fee.

- It is VITAL that you register PRIOR TO OUR FIRST 2018 CWP PRACTICE. This covers you in case of injury or anything else while playing. We could get fined if we have kids playing that are not registered

<br>

### [Medical Waiver Form](/assets/docs/Medical-Waiver.pdf)
Please complete medical waiver form prior to the first 2018 CWP event you are participating in. CWP has to have medical clearance from your parents and health insurance information on hand at all times. Click [here](/assets/docs/Medical-Waiver.pdf) for the form.

<br>

### [Concussion Awarness Form](/assets/docs/Concussion-Awareness.pdf)
Please sign and return to Lauren Hall or mail to Coach Lee prior to our first practice.  This is a League requirement.  Click [here](/assets/docs/Concussion-Awareness.pdf) for the form.

<br>

### [Physical Form](/assets/docs/CWP-Physical-Form.pdf)
Every CWP player has to have a valid physical on file for the 2018 season. Click [here](/assets/docs/CWP-Physical-Form.pdf) for the form.

<br>

### Team Communications
Please sign up for our team Remind101 messages! This is especially important for practice and other schedule changes that may be last minute (e.g. lightning in the area causes a pool closing)!
- Send a text to 81010 with @bearspolo in the message box to receive our text messages!
- You may also search for “Water Polo” under all Cambridge Remind groups on the Remind app!
- Some communications will be emailed but most team communications during the season is via the Remind app.

<br>

### Practice Schedule
TBD (We are working on deep pool facilities for our practices for this year)
- We plan to practice twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.  Times will be announced once they are set with the facilities.

<br>

### Fall Game Schedule
The fall game schedule will be released once we have it from the League.
- All games are on Saturdays and Sundays and will start in early August and run through the first two weekends of October for Division Championships
- Typically we play 11 to 12 matches in the fall season prior to the post-season tournaments.

<br>

### Swim Suits
Each athlete is responsible for acquiring their own swim suit.  Specially designed water polo suits are required by the League for all scrimmages and games. These suits are designed to provide the appropriate coverage and freedom of movement required by this rigorous sport, while minimizing the opponent’s ability to grab and manipulate players in the water.

<br>

Water polo suits are available from a variety of online sources, including:
- [http://www.kap7.com/water-polo/](http://www.kap7.com/water-polo/)
- [https://www.swimoutlet.com](https://www.swimoutlet.com)
- [https://www.tyr.com](https://www.tyr.com)
- [https://www.amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com)

<br>

### Parents
Parents are critical to support the CWP program.  Support is needed for game scorers, fundraising, marketing, photographers, end of season banquet committee, etc.  Please indicate on the athlete registration form what area of supporting the program you can help out with.

<br>

If your parent is interested in helping out with running the table for our team, please let me know so we can get you trained.  It is easy and guarantees a center pool view of the game!  It is a League requirement that there be two parents for each game as table workers (scorers).  
- Table Worker Clinics are offered by the League in August.

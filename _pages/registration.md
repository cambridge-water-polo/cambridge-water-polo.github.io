### Welcome to Cambridge’s eigth season of water polo! 
Here are the details you need to know for the upcoming 2019 Fall season.

<br>

Cambridge Water Polo (CWP) is open to all area High School and Middle School aged players.  For the 2019 fall season, we are planning to have three teams.  There will be a Division 1 (D1-B) team playing on the B tier level, a Division 3 (D3) team in the D3 North division, and a Women's Division (DW-2) team playing on the tier 2 level.  The league has split both the Division 1 and Women's Division into two tiers.  The D1-B and DW-2 Cambridge teams will be in the second tier to facilitate skill development and more equal competition.  

<br>

The league is emphasizing growing the Women's Division this fall with the introduction of the two tiers.  Women players will have a women's team first commitment if they want to play on multiple Cambridge teams when there is a game scheduling conflict.  The D3 level team is to promote the development of new players into the Cambridge Water Polo program.  The D3 level is an excellent entry point for Middle School and first year High School players to learn the game and build their water polo skills.  There will be 13 or 14 regular season games for each team, depending on the division scheduling.

<br>

### Preseason Practices
Plans are being made to have practices in July and early August before the season begins.  Coach Lee is still working on these so look forward to more information once plans are confirmed.  

<br>

### Team Communications
Please sign up for our team Remind101 messages! This is especially important for practice and other schedule changes that may be last minute (e.g. lightning in the area causes a pool closing)!
- Send a text to 81010 with @bearspolo in the message box to receive our text messages!
- You may also search for “Water Polo” under all Cambridge Remind groups on the Remind app!
- Some communications will be emailed but most team communications during the season is via the Remind app.

<br>

### Practice Schedule
TBD (We are working on deep pool facilities for our practices for this year)
- We plan to practice twice a week.  Likely on Monday and Thursday evenings.  Times will be announced once they are set with the Cumming Aquatic Center facilities.

<br>

### Fall Game Schedule
The fall game schedule will be released once we have it from the League.
- All games are on Saturdays and Sundays and will start in early August and run through the first two weekends of October for Division Championships
- Typically we play 13 to 14 matches in the fall season prior to the post-season tournaments.

<br>

### Swim Suits
Each athlete is responsible for acquiring their own swim suit.  Specially designed water polo suits are required by the League for all scrimmages and games. These suits are designed to provide the appropriate coverage and freedom of movement required by this rigorous sport, while minimizing the opponent’s ability to grab and manipulate players in the water.

<br>

Water polo suits are available from a variety of online sources, including:
- [http://www.kap7.com/water-polo/](http://www.kap7.com/water-polo/)
- [https://www.swimoutlet.com](https://www.swimoutlet.com)
- [https://www.tyr.com](https://www.tyr.com)
- [https://www.amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com)

<br>

### Parents
Parents are critical to support the CWP program.  Support is needed for game scorers, fundraising, marketing, photographers, end of season banquet committee, etc.  Please indicate on the athlete registration form what area of supporting the program you can help out with.

<br>

If you are interested in helping out with running the table for our team, please let me know so we can get you trained.  It is easy and guarantees a center pool view of the game!  It is a League requirement that there be two parents for each game as table workers (scorers).  
- Table Worker Clinics are offered by the League in August plus we have some very experienced Cambridge parents who can guide you.

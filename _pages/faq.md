### What are the basic skills of water polo?
Comfort in the water is the most fundamental water polo skill.  Swimming is part of that but swimming is considered to be "horizontal."   Being able to stay high above the water "vertically" using a leg skill called the “eggbeater” is vital to success.  We teach the eggbeater.  Learning to handle the ball with one hand is another skill that is important.   Water polo is like soccer and basketball played in the water.  The object is to score the ball in the goal on offense and prevent the ball from going in the goal on defense.  Playing solid defense and limiting turn-overs on offense are keys to the game.

### How do I learn the rules of water polo?
Unlike other sports, water polo action does not stop when the whistle blows.  Action begins when the whistle blows.  The object of the game is to throw the ball in the goal.  Goalies can touch the ball with two hands.  All other players can only touch the ball with one hand.   Fouls create free throws for the person fouled.  In some instances, when the person fouled is grossly impeded, the defender has to leave the game for 20 seconds and the offense has a “power play opportunity.”  In the worst fouls, a penalty throw is awarded.   For a more detailed explanation of the Water Polo game, see the [Water Polo Rules](/forms/rules/) brief overview.

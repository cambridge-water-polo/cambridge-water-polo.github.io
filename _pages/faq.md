### Team Communications
Please sign up for our team Remind101 messages! This is especially important for practice and other schedule changes that may be last minute (e.g. lightning in the area causes a pool closing)!
- Send a text to 81010 with @bearspolo in the message box to receive our text messages!
- You may also search for “Water Polo” under all Cambridge Remind groups on the Remind app!
- Some communications will be emailed but most team communications during the season is via the Remind app.

### Practice Schedule
Cumming Aquatic Center (The CAC worked out very well for the practices last year)
- We plan to practice twice a week on Monday and Thursday evenings.  Times will be announced once they are set with the facilities.

<br>

### Fall Game Schedule
The fall game schedule will be released once we have it from the League.
- All games are on Saturdays and Sundays and will start in early August and run through the first two weekends of October for Division Championships
- Typically we play 11 to 12 matches in the fall season prior to the post-season tournaments.  There may be 13 to 14 matches this year as the season is starting earlier.

### Swim Suits
Each athlete is responsible for acquiring their own swim suit.  Specially designed water polo suits are required by the League for all scrimmages and games. These suits are designed to provide the appropriate coverage and freedom of movement required by this rigorous sport, while minimizing the opponent’s ability to grab and manipulate players in the water.

### Parents
Parents are critical to support the CWP program.  Support is needed for assistant coaches, game scorers, fundraising, marketing, photographers, end of season banquet committee, etc.  Please indicate on the athlete registration form what area of supporting the program you can help out with.  If everyone helps out, it makes it a whole lot easier for all.  Thank you.

### What are the basic skills of water polo?
Comfort in the water is the most fundamental water polo skill.  Swimming is part of that but swimming is considered to be "horizontal."   Being able to stay high above the water "vertically" using a leg skill called the “eggbeater” is vital to success.  We teach the eggbeater.  Learning to handle the ball with one hand is another skill that is important.   Water polo is like soccer and basketball played in the water.  The object is to score the ball in the goal on offense and prevent the ball from going in the goal on defense.  Playing solid defense and limiting turn-overs on offense are keys to the game.

### How do I learn the rules of water polo?
Unlike other sports, water polo action does not stop when the whistle blows.  Action begins when the whistle blows.  The object of the game is to throw the ball in the goal.  Goalies can touch the ball with two hands.  All other players can only touch the ball with one hand.   Fouls create free throws for the person fouled.  In some instances, when the person fouled is grossly impeded, the defender has to leave the game for 20 seconds and the offense has a “power play opportunity.”  In the worst fouls, a penalty throw is awarded.   For a more detailed explanation of the Water Polo game, see the [Water Polo Rules](/forms/rules/) brief overview.

CWP scored first and kept it close trailing by only three at the half.  Turnovers and some defensive breakdowns were too much to overcome in the second half even though the team keep battling until the end of the game.  Cambridge spread around the scoring with Callum Parker scoring twice and five other players also putting the ball in Collins Hill goal.  The best scoring celebration award went to Jared Spears for his routine after he scored in the third quarter!

The CWP Defensive players of the game were Gabe Montes, Sydney Chambers, Nick Iline, and Brandon Lee in goal.

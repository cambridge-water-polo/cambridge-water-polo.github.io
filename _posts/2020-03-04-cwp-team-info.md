### Come Join Us to Play the Greatest Game!
<br>
Cambridge Water Polo Players and Families,

<br>
Interested in trying something new and fun?  Interested in staying in shape and getting in the water before swim season?
Cambridge Water Polo is looking for middle and high school students to try out the greatest sport - Water Polo!

<br>
Preparations are being made for the 2020 Cambridge Water Polo teams that will play in the GHSWPA fall season.  At this time we
do not have the final decisions with the GHSWPA League on what divisions the CWP teams will be in, but we are planning on having at
least one men's team and one women's team.  The season runs from August through the beginning of October.
The fall practice and game schedule will not be known till mid-summer.

<br>
A meeting is being held on Thursday, March 5th at 8am in Coach Hall's classroom to talk about the 2020 season.
CWP needs our returning players to help RECRUIT, RECRUIT, RECRUIT!  

<br>
CWP is open to players from the North Fulton area public and private
middle and high schools.  A mailer has been sent to the swim coaches in the area as well as for the Cambridge swim team members.  
The best way to recruit players is for current players to invite their friends and siblings. 

<br>
If you missed the March 5th meeting, it is definitely not too late!  Contact Coach Hall at halllauren@fultonschools.org or join REMIND (instructions on the FAQ) to be able to ask questions to the CWP community.

<br>
We need interested water polo players to complete the CWP 2020 registration form so we have names and contact information for the
spring water polo opportunities and then when we have our fall practice schedule.  This registration is non-binding.  It allows the
coaches to reach out and provide information so you don't miss out on water polo opportunities!

<br>
Lakeside is hosting practices and has invited CWP players to join them.  We encourage all our players to take advantage of this
opportunity.  Contact Coach Hall for more information on the Lakeside practice schedule.

<br>
Parent Volunteers - CWP needs assistant coaches and parent volunteers to make the CWP program work.  Please reach out to Coach Hall
to let her know that you will help out.  To run the CWP program, it takes parents helping out with small and large tasks.  Thanks in
advance for committing some of your time and talents to make CWP a success.

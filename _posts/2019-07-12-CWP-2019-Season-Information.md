*Cambridge Water Polo Players and Families,*

<br>

The 2019 Water Polo season will soon be upon us.  The first league games start the weekend of the 10th-11th August!

<br>

The Cambridge Water Polo program continues to grow.  This season we will have three CWP teams, a D1, D3 and Women's team.  The league is working to more equalize the competition so they introduced two tiers or levels in the Division 1 (D1) and Women's Division (DW).  Divsion 3 (D3) will be for players new to water polo and middle schoolers.  D3 is critical for the development of players and the continued success of the CWP program.  Please invite your friends to join CWP. 

<br>

Lauren Hall and I have been in communication working on the logistics and planning for the CWP 2019 season.  We will be practicing again at the Cumming Aquatic Center (CAC).  Most likely on Monday and Thursday nights.

<br>

Please read the FAQ page on the CWP website as it contains alot of key information for CWP and GHSWPA competitions.  Additionally, I wanted to pass along some information on the Cambridge Water Polo as many of you have asked about the plans for this this upcoming season.

### FAQ
**How do I register for CWP 2019?**

* Go to the Registration page on the CWP website.  Follow the directions for the electronic registration.  All parts of the form including the medical waiver and concussion awareness need to be completed and signed.  Payment can be completed using the Fulton County Schools Online Payment process.  The link to the online payment system is on the Registration webpage.  Alternatively, checks can be given to Coach Hall at Cambridge High School or mailed to Coach Lee.

<br>

**When is CWP 2019 Season Registration Due?**

* By August 8th.  All players will need to have completed the registration forms before being permitted to participate in any GHSWPA sanctioned games.

<br>

**How can I help with CWP?**

* Players: We need each returning player to talk up Cambridge Water Polo to their friends and siblings.  CWP is a club sport open to middle and high school aged students.  Especially encourage middle school kids as we need to keep a pipeline of kids coming into the CWP program.  Parents: To run the CWP program with multiple teams, I need help with additional coaches, a table worker coordinator, sponsorship coordinator, team photographer, marketing coordinator, and the end of season banquet committee.

<br>

**Do we know the fall game and practice schedule?**

* The league has completed the scheduling process.  The games will be posted soon on the CWP website Calendar as well as emailed out.  Practice times and location for the fall are being worked out.  Weâ€™ll announce the schedules when we have them.

<br>
I'm looking forward to another great season for CWP!

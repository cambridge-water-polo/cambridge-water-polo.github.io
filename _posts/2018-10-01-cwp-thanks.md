Cambridge Water Polo would not be possible if not for the many volunteer hours put in by the coaches and table workers.  A special thanks to Assistant Coaches Darren Chambers, Lauren Hall, and Rad Mignerey.  Coach Chambers took the lead with the B Team and facilitated their progression all season.  This was the first year CWP fielded two teams so having three assistant coaches along with Head Coach Brian Lee really made for a successful season.

Thanks to Jeff Dato and Lynna Lee for organizing and coordinating the CWP table workers.  From the first games in Dalton all the way through the State tournament, Jeff and Lynna made sure there were CWP trained table workers for every game.  And to our wonderful table workers - On behalf of the players and coaches, thanks to each of the many parents who volunteered at the games to operate the clock or score the game.
